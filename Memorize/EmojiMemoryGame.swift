import SwiftUI

//we have a UI, a model that is UI independent, this is a ViewModel that connects the two

class EmojiMemoryGame

    //a memory game that uses emoji as card content
    private var model: MemoryGame<String> = EmojiMemoryGame.createMemoryGame()
    
    //add static so the func is on the type instead of being a func so that the above init can call
//    HOLD OPTION AND CLICK TO GO TO DOCUMENTATION
    static func createMemoryGame() -> MemoryGame<String>

        let emojis: Array<String> = ["ðŸ‘»","ðŸŽƒ"]

    }

    //MARK: - Access to the model
    //the mark keyword provides headers for function and vars
    //we want to make view as simple as possible, do work in ViewModel to make it look like what its supposed to be
    var cards: Array<MemoryGame<String>.Card>
    {
        model.cards //one line return doesn't need "return" keyword
    }
